This project contains the source code of the web app Dominionizer, which is a set generator for the card game [Dominion](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)>) from [Rio Grande Games](https://www.riograndegames.com/).

## Get Started

Install and start the app locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Contributing

At the moment we don't accept PRs until we release our first version of the app. The first release is planned to be before end of 2020.

## Special Tanks

Firstly, we want to thank Donald X. Vaccarino, the father of Dominion, and [Rio Grande Games](https://www.riograndegames.com/) for creating and publishing this game we love to play ourselves.

We also want to thank [@sumpfork](https://github.com/sumpfork) and all the contributors of [dominiontabs](https://github.com/sumpfork/dominiontabs), which is a divider generator you can use to build your custom Dominion box. They maintain an exhaustive dataset about all dominion cards, that we use as data source for Dominionizer.
